Installation Guide
To install Bindy, simply import the package into your Unity project. 
After importing, you can start using it without doing anything else. 
For more information, check out the online documentation at https://docs.doozyui.com/

If you encounter any errors, we recommend running a Global Refresh before doing anything else. 
To do so, navigate to Tools > Doozy > Global Refresh in the Unity Editor. 
This will regenerate all databases, re-write all custom classes, and perform an integrity check.
